# Frame Extraction Domain Logic

Implement pure TypeScript domain logic for frame extraction from videos. Define core business rules, frame extraction algorithms, and data models. This should be platform-agnostic and live in the domain/ folder with no React or native dependencies. Handle frame rate calculations, timestamp management, and extraction parameters.
