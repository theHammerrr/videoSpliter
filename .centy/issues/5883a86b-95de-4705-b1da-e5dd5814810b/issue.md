# Performance Optimization for Large Videos

Optimize app performance for processing large video files efficiently. Implement memory management strategies, background processing, and chunked frame extraction to prevent app crashes or freezes. Add progress indicators and ensure UI remains responsive during processing. Profile and optimize FFmpeg operations, implement caching strategies, and handle device resource constraints gracefully.
