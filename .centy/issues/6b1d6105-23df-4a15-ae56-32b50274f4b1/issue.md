# Comprehensive Error Handling

Implement robust error handling throughout the application. Handle common failure scenarios: unsupported video formats, insufficient storage space, permission denials, corrupted videos, and processing failures. Provide user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance. Implement logging for debugging, graceful degradation, and recovery strategies. Ensure errors don't crash the app and users can retry or cancel operations.
