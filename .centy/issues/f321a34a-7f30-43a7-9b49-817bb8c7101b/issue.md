# Frame Preview UI

Implement a screen to preview extracted frames before export. Display frames in a scrollable grid or list view with thumbnails. Allow users to review frame quality, select/deselect specific frames, and zoom in for detailed inspection. Include frame metadata display (timestamp, frame number) and smooth navigation between frames.
