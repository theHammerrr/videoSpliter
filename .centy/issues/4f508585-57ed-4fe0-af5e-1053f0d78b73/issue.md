# Extraction Configuration UI

Build the configuration screen where users can set extraction parameters. Include controls for frame rate (e.g., every Nth frame, frames per second), output format (JPEG/PNG), quality settings, and output directory selection. Provide real-time estimates of resulting frame count and storage requirements. Use form validation and user-friendly input controls.
